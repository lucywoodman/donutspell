# Donutspell

A word game for 6-9 year olds. Save the donut before Ripley the dog eats them by guessing the hidden words.

The words used for the game are common "tricky" to spell words, as set by the UK school curriculum. The "Easy" level uses year 1 words (ages 5-6), the "Tricky" level uses year 2 words (ages 6-7), and the "Difficult" level uses years 3 and 4 words (ages 7-9).
